<!-- With an animated background, performance will differ depending on whether
     one layer or two layers are being blended together. This messes up our
     benchmarks. We could just benchmark a single image, but since blended
     images are present for much of the day with the GNOME default background,
     we want to make sure that also performs well; for that reason we ship
     an "animated" background that animates super-slowly to use during
     performance tests; it will be in the blended state until 2030. -->
